# ADM-HW1

I mixed up my personal and institutional emails as after I was originally registered for ADM with the personal gmail, I also received the Sapienza gmail. I will list here all that information and also a file with the AWS modules results, as I was originally registered with my personal email. I am sorry for the problem I caused! I get all my emails in one place and didn't notice, it won't happen again!

Sapienza gmail: branescu.2125078@studenti.uniroma1.it

Personal gmail: ana.branescu03@gmail.com

AWS account: ana.branescu03@gmail.com

Since I uploaded the original .py file, I found out I had to export it as .ipynb for my python code in Jupyter Notebook. I left the original file that was uploaded before the deadline (2125078_ADM_HW1_solutions.py) and I also uploaded the same script exported as Jupyter Notebook one a couple of minutes after the deadline.

The purpose of this repository is to submit the first ADM Homework 23/24.

Each directory provides the following files:

- 2125078_ADM_HW1_solutions.py : solutions of the completed ADM Homework 1 exercises. Problem 1 and 2.

- 2125078_ADM_HW1_solutions.ipynb : solutions of the completed ADM Homework 1 exercises. Problem 1 and 2 in Jupyter Notebook.

- 2125078_ADM_HW1_solutions.pdf : PDF assessing the successful exercises. Problem 1 and 2.
  
- README.md file: description of the repository
