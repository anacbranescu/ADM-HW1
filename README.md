# ADM-HW1

Please read! I made an error, I am sorry!! Since I uploaded the original .py file, I found out I had to export it as .ipynb for my python code in Jupyter Notebook. I left the original file that was uploaded before the deadline (2125078_ADM_HW1_solutions.py) and I also uploaded the same script exported as Jupyter Notebook one a couple of minutes after the deadline. I hope this isn't a problem regarding the deadline policy and I apologise again for my mistake!

The purpose of this repository is to submit the first ADM Homework 23/24.

Each directory provides the following files:

- 2125078_ADM_HW1_solutions.py : solutions of the completed ADM Homework 1 exercises. Problem 1 and 2.

- 2125078_ADM_HW1_solutions.ipynb : solutions of the completed ADM Homework 1 exercises. Problem 1 and 2 in Jupyter Notebook.

- 2125078_ADM_HW1_solutions.pdf : PDF assessing the successful exercises. Problem 1 and 2.
  
- README.md file: description of the repository
